                    <p>
                        If you're thinking about getting a dog and you've never had one, please do some research first on how to choose a dog. Learn about what's involved in having a dog: basic dog care, medical needs, training and behavior. In particular, ask yourself the following:<br>

                        &diams;Do I have the time to give a dog the love and attention she deserves?<br>
                        &diams;Can I offer her daily exercise and interaction with people and other dog friends?<br>
                        &diams;Can I afford the costs of having a dog (food, routine vet care, and possible additional medical costs, such as medication)?<br>
                        &diams;Are my emotional expectations realistic? (A dog is not a furry little person.)<br>
                        &diams;Will she be living in the house as a valued family member? (Dogs are pack animals and don't do well living alone outside.)
                    </p>

                        <h2>Choosing a carrier</h2>

                        Find a job you love, and you will never work a day in your life. It's an old saying that may resonate with you if you're in the middle of trying to figure out what to do with your life. If you choose the right career, you will actually like going to work every day? Imagine that! It sounds like a magical antidote to a life of drudgery.

                        It's no wonder the task of picking an occupation may seem overwhelming.


                        With thousands of careers to choose from, how do you pick one that will make you feel like you aren't even working? Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it would at least be nice to work at a job you like going to most of the time. To find the right career, choose one that suits your interests, aptitudes, work-related values, and personality type. While you should also consider earnings, job outlook, and duties, nothing contributes more to job satisfaction than matching your occupation to your character traits and motivations. How do you go about doing this?
